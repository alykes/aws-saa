## Section 11 - Classic Solutions Architecture Discussions  

### Solutions Architecture Discussions Overview  
- Piecing together how all the solutions discussed so far work together  
- You need to be extremely comfortable with this section  
- There are a bunch of case studies that should be reviewed to understand this section  
- The case studies are:  
  - WhatIsTheTime.com  
  - MyClothes.com  
  - MyWordPress.com  
  - Instantiating applications quickly  
  - Beanstalk  

### WhatIsTheTime.com  
  - Stateless Web App  
  - This website allows people to know what time it is  
  - It doesn't need a database  
  - Would like to start small and can accept downtime  
  - Would like to scale vertically and horizontally with no downtime  
- `Starting simple`  
  - T2 micro with Elastic IP  
- `Scale vertically`  
  - More traffic, so we increase the CPU/RAM by changing the instance type  
- `Scale horizontally`  
  - Even more traffic, adding instances with an Elastic IP for each  
- `Change the approach`  
  - remove the Elastic IPs  
  - set up Route 53  
  - `A` record with list of IPs  
  - TTL of 60 minutes  
- `Add/Remove instances on the fly`  
  - Add a load balancer  
  - ELB + Health Checks  
  - Security Group rules to the private instances  
  - Use an Alias Record in route 53  
- `Make use of an Auto Scaling Group`  
  - Create a launch template  
  - Create a target group  
- `Multi-AZ`  
  - ELB + Health Checks + Multi-AZ  
  - Auto Scaling Groups are made multi-AZ  
- `Reduce costs`  
  - reserve instances!  
- `Summary of steps`    
  - Public vs Private IP and EC2 instances  
  - Elastic IP vs Route 53 vs Load Balancers  
  - Route 53 TTL, A records and Alias Records  
  - Maintaining EC2 instances manually vs Auto Scaling Groups  
  - Multi AZ to survive disasters  
  - ELB Health Checks  
  - Security Group Rules  
  - Reservation of capacity for cost savings when possible  
  - We need to consider the 5 pillars for a well architected application:  
    - cost  
    - performance  
    - reliability  
    - security  
    - operation excellence  

### MyClothes.com  
- The site allows people to buy clothes online  
- There is a shopping cart  
- Hundreds of users at the same time  
- Needs to scale, maintain horizontal scalability and keep the web application as stateless as possible  
- Users should not lose their shopping cart  
- Users should have their details in a DB  
- `State of Play`  
  - ASG, ELB and route 53 in use  
- `Add stickiness`  
  - Enable ELB stickiness so that the web requests go to the same instances  
- `Improve statelessness`  
  - introduce user cookies  
  - cons:  
    - security risk as cookies can be altered    
    - more HTTP requests  
    - cookies must be validated  
    - cookies must be less than 4KB  
- `Server Sessions`  
  - Use Elasticache cluster to keep session IDs  
  - Elasticache is used to store and retreive session data  
  - (could also use DynamoDB)  
- `Storing User Data`  
  - Spin up RDS  
- `Scaling Reads`
  - You can use an RDS master and a bunch of read replicas  
  - Alternative is to use Lazy Loading in ElastiCache, this reduces load on RDS   
- `Resilient to Disasters`  
  - Make the application Multi-AZ by configuring the following to use multi-AZ:  
    - ELB  
    - ASG  
    - Elasticache  
    - RDS  
- `Security`  
  - Restrict internet traffic to only go through the ELB  
  - RDS only allows traffic from the EC2 security groups  
  - ElastiCache only allows traffic from the EC2 security groups  
  - EC2 instances only allows traffic from the ELB security groups  
- `Summary of steps`    
  - ELB Sticky Sessions  
  - Web clietns for storing cookies and making web app stateless  
  - `Elasticache`  
    - for storing sessions (could also use DynamoDB)  
    - used to cache data from RDS  
    - Multi-AZ  
  - `RDS`  
    - storing user data  
    - read replicas for scaling reads  
    - Multi-AZ for DR  
  - `Security`  
    - Security groups referencing each other to lock down security more  

### MyWordPress.com  
- A stateful web application  
- create a fully scalable website to access and correctly display uploaded pictures  
- user data and blog content should be stored in a MySQL database  
- `State of Play`  
  - ASG, ELB and route 53, RDS in Multi-AZ config  
- `Scaling DB`  
  - Use Aurora for Multi-AZ and Read Replicas  
- `Storing Images`  
  - Use EBS for a single instance  
  - Use EFS for a distributed application and allows for scaling  
    - EFS creates an ENI in each AZ  
- `Summary of steps`   
  - Aurora Database to have Multi-AZ and read replicas  
  - storing data in EBS (single instance application)  
  - storing data in EFS (distributed application)  

### Instantiating applications quickly  
- When launching a full stack (EC2, EBS, RDS) it can take time to:  
  - install applications  
  - insert initial data (or recovery data)  
  - configure everything  
  - launch the application 
- `EC2 Instances`  
  - `Use a golden AMI`: install the applications, OS dependencies, configs etc so that you can launch from an AMI  
  - `Bootstrap using User Data`: for dynamic configuratiohn use User Data scripts  
  - `Hybrid`: mix a golden AMI and user data (Elastic Beanstalk uses this method)  
- `RDS Databases`  
  - `Restore from a snapshot`: the DB will have schemas and the data available quickly  
- `EBS Volumes`  
  - `Restore from a snapshot`: the disk will already be formatted and the data will be available quickly  

### Beanstalk - Developer Issues 
- Managing infrastructure  
- deploying code  
- configuring the databases, load balancers etc  
- scaling concerns  
- Most Web apps have the same architecture - ALB + ASG  
- all developers want is for their code to run  
- possibly, consistenly across difference applications and environments  

### Beanstalk Overview  
- Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an applications on AWS  
- it uses all the following components: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS  
- `Managed Service`:  
  - Automatically handles capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, application health monitoring, instance configuration  
  - The responsibility of the developer will now only be the application code  
- We still have full control over the configuration  
- A unified interface for all of this  
- Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances  

### Beanstalk - Components  
- `Application`: A collection of Elastic Beanstalk components - environment, versions, configurations  
- `Application Versions`: an iteration of your application code  
- `Environment`:  
  - Collection of AWS resources running an application version - only one application version can be run at a time  
  - `Tiers`: `Web Server Environment Tier` and `Worker Environment Tier`  
  - You can create multiple environments - for dev, test, prod etc  
- `Flow`  
 - **create the application** -> **upload the version** -> **launch the environment** -> **manage the environment**  

### Beanstalk - Supported Platforms  
- Go  
- Java SE  
- Java with Tomcat  
- .net core on linux  
- .net on Windows Server  
- node.js  
- php  
- python  
- ruby  
- packer build  
- docker  
  - single container  
  - multi-container  
  - preconfigured  

### Beanstalk Tiers  
- `Web Tier`: Traditional Stack - Has an ELB, a couple of AZs and an ASG  
- `Worker Tier`: SQS Queue - Has an SQS Queues, an ASG and a couple of AZs (Scales based on the number of SQS messages)  
  - You can push messages to the SQS quese from another `Web Server Environment Tier`  

### Beanstalk Deployment Modes  
- `Single Instance` - One Elastic IP, one EC2 instance and one RDS master - good for dev work  
- `High Availability with Load Balancer` - ALB, ASG, RDS Master + Standby - good for Prod
