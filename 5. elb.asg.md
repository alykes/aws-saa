## Section 8 - High Availability and Scalability: ALB & ASG  

### High Availability and Scalability  
- Scalability means an Application or System can handle greater loads by adapting  
- There are two kinds of scalability:  
  - Vertical  
  - Horizontal aka Elasticity  
- **Scalability is linked but different to High availability**  

### Vertical Scaling  
- Means to increase the size of an instance  
  - eg, t3.micro -> t3.large  
- Common practise for non-distributed systems like a database  
- RDS, elasticache are services that can scale vertically  
- There is usually a (hardware) limit to this type of scaling  

### Horizontal Scaling  
- Means to increase the number of instances for your applications  
- Horizontal scaling means distributed systems  
- Common for most modern applications such as web apps  
- Easy to scale horizontally in the cloud  

### High Availability  
- Usually goes together with horizontal scaling  
- high availability generally means to run your application in at least 2 AZs  
- The goal of HA is to survive a DC loss  
- The HA can be passive (RDS Multi-AZ)  
- The HA can be active (horizontal scaling with an ELB and ASG)  

### High Availability and Scalability for EC2  
- Vertical Scaling:  
  - Increase size (scale up) or decrease size (scale down)  
- Horizontal Scaling:  
  - Auto Scaling Groups (scale in or scale out)  
  - Load Balancers  
- High Availability:  
  - Run instances for the same application across multiple AZs  
  - Auto Scaling Groups in Multi-AZ  
  - Load Balancer in Multi-AZ  

### Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)  
- What is an ELB?  
  - Load Balancers are servers that forward traffic to multiple servers (eg EC2) downstream  
- Why use an ELB?  
  - Spread load across multiple downstream instances  
  - Expose a single point of access via DNS, for your application  
  - seamlessly handle failures of the downstream instances  
  - regular health checks of your instances  
  - Provide SSL termination for your websites  
  - Enforce stickiness with cookies  
  - High Availability, by using multiple zones  
  - Seperate public traffic from private traffic  
- An ELB is an **managed load balancer**  
  - AWS guarantees that it will be working  
  - AWS takes care of maintenance, upgrades and HA  
  - AWS provides only a few configuration settings for an ELB  
- It costs less to set up your own load balancer but will be require more management  
- It's an integrated offering with:  
  - EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon ECS  
  - AWS ACM, Cloudwatch  
  - Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator  

### ELB Heath Checks  
- Heath checks are crucial for load balancers  
- They enable the load balancers to query whether the instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests  
- The health check is done on a port and a route (normally `/health`)  
- If the response is not a `200` then the instance is in an unhealthy state  

### Types of Load Balancers  
- AWS has four types of Load Balancers  
- `Classic Load Balancer (v1 - old generation; est. 2009 - depracated)`: CLB  
  - HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (Secure TCP)  
- `Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation; est. 2016)`: ALB  
  - HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket  
- `Network Load Balancer (v2 - new generation; est. 2017)`: NLB  
  - TCP, TLS (Secure TCP), UDP  
- `Gateway Load Balancer (est. 2020)`: GWLB  
  - Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) - IP Protocol  
- Overall, it's recommended not to use the Classic Load Balancer  
- Some load balancers can be setup as `internal` (private) or `external` (public)  

### ELB Rules  
- Managed by a security group  
- Generally you will have HTTP, HTTPS (or whatever port) open to the world `0.0.0.0/0`  
- The downstream instances should only allow traffic from the load balancer and no-where else  
  - Therefore the `Source` will be the security group of the load balancer, not an IP address  

### Note about the Class Load Balancer  
- This has now been depracated and will not be available in the console  
- It seems that the exam may have already removed all references to it  

### Application Load Balancers (ALB)  
- Application Load Balancers are Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)  
- Load balancing multiple HTTP applications across instances (Target Groups)  
- Load balancing to multiple applications on the same instance (eg, containers)  
- Support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket  
- Support redirecting (from HTTP to HTTPS)  
- Routing tables to different Target Groups:  
  - routing based on path in URL - example.com/**users** or example.com/**posts**  
  - routing based on hostname in URL - **one**.example.com or **two**.example.com  
  - routing based on query string, headers - example.com/**users?id=1234&order=true**  
- ALBs are great for microservices and container based applications (Docker and Amazon ECS)  
  - Have port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS  
  - In comparison, you'd need one Classic Load Balancer per application!

### Application Load Balancer (v2) - Target Groups  
- EC2 instance can be managed by Auto Scaling Groups - HTTP  
- ECS tasks are managed by ECS itself - HTTP  
- lamdba functions - HTTP request is translates into a JSON event  
- IP Address - must be private IPs  
- ALB can route to multiple target groups  
- Health Checks are at the target group level  

### ALB - Good to know  
- They have a fixed hostname - xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com  
- The application servers don't see the IP of the client directly  
  - The true IP of the clien is inseerted in the header `X-Forwarded-For`  
  - We can also get the port (X-Forwarded-Port) and protocol (X-Forwarded-Proto)  

### ALB Hands-On  
- When you create the Security groups **(do the following so that the instances aren't directly reachable)**:  
  - Ensure the EC2 instance security groups point to the security group of the ALB for inbound TCP/HTTP traffic  
    - `Type:HTTP | Source: <Security Group Name of the ALB>`  
  - The ALB Security group should allow TCP/HTTP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0  
    - `Type:HTTP | Source: 0.0.0.0/0`  

### Network Load Balancer (NLB)  
- Network load balancers (Layer 4) allow:  
  - **forwarding of TCP and UDP traffic to your instances**  
  - handle millions of requests per second  
  - have less latency ~100ms vs ~400ms for an ALB  
- **An NLB has one static IP per AZ and supports the assignment of an Elastic IP**  
  - Useful if you need to whitelist an IP  
  - `EXAM TIP`: **If the exam says that your application can only be accessed by 1, 2 or 3 IPs, then think NLB**  
- NLBs are used for extreme performance of TCP and UDP traffic  

### NLB Target Groups  
- Targets can be:  
  - EC2 instances  
  - IP Addresses - must be private IPs and therefore, this allows the use of your own server in an on-prem DC   
  - Application Load Balancer - You would do this if you want the ALB to use a more extensive ruleset that comes with an ALB   
  - `EXAM TIP` : **Health Check support TCP, HTTP and HTTPS Protocols**  

### Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)   
- Deploy, scale and manage a fleet of 3rd party virtual network appliances in AWS  
  - eg, firewalls, IDP, IDS, Deep Packet Inspection Systems, payload manipulators etc  
- Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) - IP Packets  
- Combines the following functions:  
  - `Transparent Network Gateway`: Single entry/exit for all traffic, good inspection tool for ALL traffic  
  - `Load Balancer`: distributes traffic to your virtual appliances  
- Uses the `GENEVE` protocol on port `6081`  
- Traffic Flow: `Users` -> `GWLB` -> `Target Group containing virtual network devices` -> `GWLB` -> `Application Servers/Instances`  

### GWLB Target Groups  
- **EC2 instances**  
- **IP Addresses**: must be private IPs, this allows the use of your own server in an on-prem DC    

### Sticky Sessions - Session Affinity  
- It's possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer  
- This works for CLB, NLB and ALBs  
- The **cookie** used for stickiness has an expiration date that you can control  
- Use Cases:  
  - making sure that a user doesn't lose their session data  
- Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances  

### Sticky Sessions - Cookie Names  
- Stickiness is configured on the Target Group  
- `Application Based Cookies`  
  - `Custom Cookie`:  
    - Generated by the target  
    - can include any custom attribute required by the application  
    - Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group  
    - Don't use the following names (which are reserved by the ELB):  
      - AWSALB  
      - AWSALBAPP  
      - AWSALBTG  
  - `Application Cookie`:  
    - Generated by the load balancer  
    - Cookie Name is `AWSALBAPP`  
- `Duration Based Cookie`:  
  - Cookie generated by the load balancer  
  - Cookie name is `AWSALB` for the ALB  
  - Cookie name is `AWSELB` for the CLB  
- **NOTE**: The NLB doesn't use cookies!!!  

### ELB - Cross Zone Load Balancing  
- With Cross-Zone Load Balancing - each Load Balancer instance distributes traffic evenly across all registered instances in all AZs - traffic can be sent to another AZ for balancing  
  - without it, the traffic is distributed to the each Load Balance instance but the traffic remains in the AZ of the ELB that received the traffic - it will not be even across all instances as the traffic stays in the AZ  
- The setting can be toggled under the `attributes` tab for each of the load balancers (except the ALB - it's on the Target Group instead)  
- `ALB`:  
  - Enabled by default  
  - Can be disabled at the **Target Group level** (not the LB level like the others) - the setting is under the `Target Group` -> `Attributes` -> `Target selection configuration`  
    - The setting can be `inherit`, `on` or `off`  
  - No charges for inter AZ data  
- `NLB and GWLB`:  
  - Disabled by default  
  - you pay for inter AZ data if enabled  
- `CLB`:  
  - Disabled by default    
  - No charges for inter AZ data  

### ELB - SSL Certificates  
- `Basics`  
  - An SSL cert encrypts traffic between your clients and your load balancers, encrypted in transit  
  - `SSL` is Secure Socket Layer, used to encrypt connections  
  - `TLS` is Transport Layer Security, newer version  
    - TLS certificates are the most used but are still referred to as SSL by some people  
  - Public SSL certs are issued by a CA or Certificate Authority  
    - Some popular CA : Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign, Digicert, Letsencrypt etc  
  - SSL certificates have an expiration date and must be renewed  
- `Load Balancer - SSL Certificates`  
  - The load balancer uses an X.509 certificate (SSL/TLS cert)  
  - You can manage certs with Amazon Certificate Manager  
  - You can create and upload your own certs as an alternative  
  - HTTPS listener:  
    - You must specify a default cert  
    - You can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains  
    - `EXAM TIP`: **Clients can use SNI (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they will reach**  
    - Provide the ability to specify a security policy to support older versions of SSL/TLS (legacy clients)  
- `SSL - Server Name Indication (SNI)`  
  - SNI solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certs onto a web server (to server multiple websites)  
  - It's a **newer** protocol and requires clients to **indicate** the hostname of the target server in the initial SSL handshake  
  - The server will then find the correct certificate or return the default one  
  - **NOTE**:  
    - this only works for ALB, NLB and Cloudfront  
    - Does not work for CLB  
- `Elastic Load Balancers - SSL Certificates`  
  - **CLB**  
    - supports one SSL cert  
    - must use multiple CLB for multiple hostname with multiple SSL certs  
  - **ALB**  
    - supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certs  
    - uses SNI to make it work  
  - **NLB**  
    - supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certs  

### ELB - Connection Draining  
- Feature naming  
  - CLB - Connection Draining  
  - ALB and NLB - Deregistration Delay  
- Time to complete "in-flight" requests while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy  
- Stops sending new requests to the EC2 instance which is de-registering  
- can take between 1-3600 seconds (default is 300)  
- can be disabled  
- set to a low value if your requests are short  

### Austo Scaling Groups  
- `Overview`  
  - load on your websites and applications change over time  
  - in the cloud, you are able to create and delete servers as quickly  
  - The goal of auto scaling (ASG) is to:  
    - scale out EC2 instances to match the increased load  
    - scale in EC2 instances to match the decreased load  
    - ensure we have a minimum and maximum number of instances running  
    - automatically register new instances to load balancers  
    - re-create an EC2 instance in case a previous one fails or is terminated  
  - `EXAM TIP`: **An ASG is free, you just pay for the underlying infrastructure**  
- `Auto Scaling Group Attributes`  
  - A **Launch Template** consists of:  
    - AMI + Instance Type  
    - EC2 user data  
    - EBS volume  
    - Security Groups  
    - SSH Key Pair  
    - IAM Roles for your EC2 instances  
    - Network + subnet information   
    - Load Balancer information  
    - Min Size, Max Size and Initial capacity  
- `Auto Scaling - Cloud Watch Alarms and Scaling`  
  - it's possible to scale an ASG based on CloudWatch alarms  
  - An alarm monitors the metrics (eg avg CPU, or some other custom metric)  
  - `EXAM TIP`: **metrics like AVG CPU are computed for the overall ASG instances**  
  - based on the alarm:  
    - you can create scale-out policies (increase instances)  
    - you can create scale-in policies (decrease instances)  
- `Auto Scaling Group - Scaling Policies`  
  - `Dynamic Scaling`  
    - `Target Tracking Scaling`  
      - simple to set up  
      - eg: you would like average cpu to stay at 40%  
    - `Simple/Step Scaling`  
      - when a cloudwatch alarm is triggered; eg CPU > 80%, add 3 more instances  
      - when a cloudwatch alarm is triggered; eg CPU < 20%, remove 2 instances  
  - `Scheduled Scaling`  
    - anticipate scaling requirements based on known usage patterns  
    - eg: min capacity between 9am and 5pm on Mondays should be increased  
  - `Predictive Scaling`  
    - continuously forecasts lad and schedule scaling ahead of time  
- `Good metrics to monitor and scale from`  
  - `CPU Utilisation`: average CPU utilisation across all instances  
  - `RequestCountPerTarget`: ensure the request count per instance is stable  
  - `Average Network In/Out`: if your application is network bound  
  - `Any custom metric`: something that your application pushing to CloudWatch  
- `Auto Scaling Groups - Scaling Cooldowns`  
  - After a scaling happens, there is a **cooldown period**, the default is 300 seconds  
  - during the cooldown, the ASG will not launch or terminate additional instances (this is for metric stabilisation)  
  - Recommended practice is to use pre-built AMIs to reduce configuration times, reducing the time to start serving requests faster and therefore having room to reduce the cooldown
