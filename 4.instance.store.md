## Section 7 - Instance Storage  

### EBS Overview  
- EBS is Elastic Block Storage, commonly referred to as an EBS Volume.  
- It is a network drive that you can attach to your instances while they run.  
- It allows your instance to persist data, even after their termination.  
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at CCP level), you can use `multi-attach` for SA, Dev and SysOps level exam  
- They are bound to one AZ only  
- Free tier gives you 30GB of General Purpose SSD or magnetic storage per month  

### EBS Volume  
- It is a network drive - **Not a physical drive!**  
  - it uses the network to communicate to the EC2 instance, therefore might be prone to latency  
  - it can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one easily and quickly  
- It is bound to an AZ  
  - Therefore you can't attach a volume from one AZ to an instance in another AZ  
  - If you want to move it, you need to snapshot it first  
- They have a provisioned capacity in GBs and IOPS  
  - You are billed for the provisioned capacity and not just for what you use  
  - You can increase the capacity of the drive as needed  
- You can create an EBS volume and leave it unattached for use later

### Delete on Termination Attribute    
- Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance is terminated  
  - by default, the root volume is deleted  
  - by default, all other attached EBS volumes are **NOT** deleted  
- You can change this in the AWS console or through the CLI  
- **Use Case: You would like to preserve the volume once the instance is terminated**  

### EBS Snapshots  
- Make a backup of your EBS Volume at a point in time  
- You don't have to detach the volume to take a snapshot - **but is recommended**  
- You can **copy** snapshots across AZs  
- You can **create a volume** from a snapshot so you can attach it to an EC2 instance - **you can target a different AZ**  

### EBS Snapshots Features    
- `EBS Snapshot Archive`  
  - Move a snapshot to an **"archive tier"** that is **75% cheaper**  
  - If you do this, it will take 24 to 72 hours to restore  
- `Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots`  
  - You have to create a retention rule to enable this on first use  
  - Set up rules to retain deleted snapshots so they can be recovered from accidental deletion  
  - Retention can be 1 day to 1 year  
- `Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)`  
  - Force full initialisation of snapshots to have no latency on their first use, but is **very expensive**  

### AMI Overview  
- AMI is Amazon Machine Image  
- AMIs are a **customisation** of an EC2 instance  
  - You can your own software, configuration, OS etc  
  - It has a faster boot/configuration time because everything is already pre-packaged  
- AMIs are built for a **specific region** - but can be copied across regions!  
- You can launch EC2 instances via different AMI types:  
  - A `Public AMI`: eg, the ones provided by AWS  
  - `Your own AMIs`: ones that you create and maintain yourself  
  - An `AWS Marketplace AMI`: An AMI that someone else (3rd party) creates, sells (potentially) and maintains  

### AMI Process - EC2 Instance  
- Start the EC2 instance and customise it  
- Stop the EC2 instance  
- Build the AMI - which created a EBS Snapshots during the process  
- Launch instances from the AMI  

### Instance Store  
- EBS Volumes are **network drives** with good but limited performance  
- **If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use an EC2 Instance Store**  
- Better I/O Performance  
- EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they are stopped - **ephemeral**  
- Good for buffer/cache/scratch/temporary data  
- Risk of data loss if the hardware fails  
- Backups and Replication are your responsibility
- Instances that start with `i`, then it has an instance store attached to it - i3.large, i3.16xlarge, i3.metal, i3en.24xlarge etc  

### EBS Volume Types  
- EBS Volumes come in six different categories:  
  - `gp2 and gp3 (SSD)`: General Purpose SSD Volume, balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads  
  - `io1 and io2 Block Express (SSD)`: Highest Performance SSD Volumes for mission critical, low latency and high-throughput workloads  
  - `st1 (HDD)`: Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput intensive workloads  
  - `sc1 (HDD)`: **Lowest cost** HDD volume that is designed for less frequently accessed workloads  
- EBS volumes are characterised by Size, Throughput and IOPS  
- When in doubt consult the AWS documentation  
- `EXAM TIP`: **Only gp2/gp3/io1/io2 Block Express can be used as boot volumes**  

### EBS Volume Types and Use Cases  
- `General Purpose SSD`  
  - Cost effective storage, that has low latency  
  - System boot volumes, virtual desktops, development and test environments  
  - 1 GiB - 16TiB  
  - `gp3`:  
    - Baseline of 3000 IOPS and throughput of 125MiB/s  
    - IOPS can be increased up to 16000 and throughput to 1000MiB/s  
    - `EXAM TIP`: **Size of the volume and IOPS are NOT linked**  
  - `gp2`:  
    - Small gp2 volumes can burst up to 3000 IOPS  
    - `EXAM TIP`: **Size of the volume and IOPS are linked**, max IOPS is 16000  
    - 3 IOPS per GB, means at 5,334GB you hit the max IOPS  
- `Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD`  
  - Used for critical business applications with needs sustained IOPS performance  
  - or used with applications that need more than 16000 IOPS  
  - Great for **database workloads** (which are sensitive to storage performance and consistency)  
  - `io1 (4GiB to 16TiB)`:  
    - Max PIOPS: **64,000 for Nitro EC2 instances** and 32,000 for others  
    - You can increase the PIOPS independently fronm the storage size  
  - `io2 Block Express (4GiB to 64TiB)`:  
    - sub-millisecond latency  
    - Max PIOPS: 256,000 with IOPS:GB ratio of 1000:1    
    - **io2 IOPS are dependent on the size of the storage provisioned**  
  - **NOTE: These volume types support multi-attach**  
- `HDD`  
  - **These CANNOT be a root volume**  
  - 125GiB to 16TiB  
  - `st1 Throughput Optimised HDD`:  
    - Suitable for Big Data, Data Warehouses, Log Processing  
    - Max throughput of 500MiB/s - max IOPS of 500  
  - `sc1 Cold HDD`:  
    - Suitable for data that is infrequently accessed    
    - Scenarios were lowest cost is important  
    - Max throughput of 250MiB/s - max IOPS of 250  
- Reference https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.html  
      
### EBS Multi-Attach  
- Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the **same AZ**  
- Each instance has full read/write permissions to the high-performance volume  
- Use cases:  
  - Achieve **higher application availability** in clustered linux applications (such as terradata)  
  - applications must be able to manage concurrent write operations  
- `EXAM TIP`: **You can attach the volume up to a maximum of 16 EC2 instance at a time**   
- You must use a file system that cluster-aware (not XFS or EXT4 etc)  

### EBS Encryption  
- When you create an encrypted volume, you get the following:  
  - Data at Rest is encrypted inside the volume  
  - All the data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted  
  - All snapshots are encrypted  
  - All volumes creates from the snapshot are encrypted  
- Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (the user doesn't need to do anything)  
- Encryption has minimal impact on latency and therefore **should** be used!    
- `EXAM TIP`: **EBS encryption leverages keys from KMS - AES-256**  
- Copying an unecrypted snapshot allows you to encrypt the volume  
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted  
- `Encryption Process: encrypt an unencrypted EBS volume`  
  - Create an EBS Snapshot of the volume  
  - Encrypt the EBS Snapshot (using copy)  
  - Create the new EBS volume from the snapshot (the volume will also be encrypted)  
  - Now you can attach the encypted volume to the original instance  

 ### Amazon EFS - Elastic File System    
- `Summary`  
  - Managed NFS (Network File System) that can be mounted to **many** EC2 instances  
  - EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-AZ  
  - Highly Available, Scalable, expensive (about 3 times as much as gp2), pay per use (for each GB)  
  - Use Cases:  
    - content management, web server, data sharing, wordpress  
  - uses the NFSv4.1 protocol  
  - **uses security groups to control access to the EFS**  
    - uses NFS protocol TCP/2049   
  - `EXAM TIP`: **compatible with Linux based AMI (NOT windows)**  
  - enable encryption at rest for your EFS drive using KMS  
  - POSIX file system (Linux) that has a standard file API  
  - file system scales automatically, pay-per-use, no capacity planning is required    
- `EFS Performance and Storage Class`  
  - `EFS Scale`  
    - 1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10GB/s+ throughput  
    - Grow to Petabyte-scale network file system automatically  
  - `Performance Mode (set at EFS creation)`  
    - **General Purpose (Recommended)**: latency-sensitive use cases (web server, CMS etc)  
      - This is the only option when using **Elastic(Recommended)** for **Throughput mode**    
    - **Max I/O**: higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing)  
  - `Throughput Mode`  
    - **Bursting** : Provides throughput that scales  
      - 1TB = 50MiB/s+ burst up to 100MiB/s  
      - for workloads with basic performance requirements  
    - **Enhanced**:  
      - **Provisioned** : when you want to **set your throughput regardless of storage size** 
        - 1GiB/s to 1 TB of storage, you pay for throughput   
        - used for predictable workloads
      - **Elastic (recommended)** : automatically scales throughput up or down based on your workloads, pay for what you use  
        - Up to 3GiB/s for reads and 1GiB/s for writes  
        - Used for unpredictable workloads  
- `EFS Storage Class`  
  - `Storage Tiers (lifecycle management feature - move file after N days)`  
    - **Standard**: for frequently accessed files   
    - **Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)**: cost associated to retrieve files, lower price to store files. Enables EFS-IA with lifecycle policy  
  - `Availability and Durability`  
    - **Regional(used to be called Standard)**: Multi-AZ, good for production   
    - **One-Zone**: One AZ, good for Dev, backups enabled by default, compatible with IA (EFS One Zone-IA)  
    - Over 90% in cost savings  
- `EXAM TIP`: **It will ask, when should you use EFS and what options should you use it with?**  

### EBS vs EFS - Differences  
- `EBS Volume`  
  - Basic Info   
    - One instance (except multi-attach io1, io2 Block Express)  
    - locked to an AZ  
    - gp2: IO increases as disk size increases  
    - gp3 & io1: IO and disk size increases are independant  
  - To migrate an EBS volume to another AZ  
    - Take a snapshot  
    - Restore(copy) the snapshot to another AZ  
    - EBS backup use IO and you shouldn't them if your application is handling a lot of traffic  
  - Root EBS volumes of instances are terminated by default if the EC2 instance is terminated (can be disabled)  
- `EFS`  
  - can mount 100s of instances across AZ in the same region  
  - use EFS to share website files (wordpress)  
  - only for linux systems (POSIX)  
  - EFS has a higher price point than EBS  
  - Can leverage EFS-IA for cost savings
