## Section 10 - Route 53

### What is DNS?  
- Domain Name System which translates the human friendly name into IP addresses  
- `www.google.com` -> `172.217.24.36`  
- DNS is the backbone of the internet  
- DNS heirarchical naming structure  
  - .com  
  - example.com  
  - one.example.com  
  - sub.one.example.com  

### DNS Terminology  
- `Domain Registrar` - Amazon Route 53, GoDaddy  
- `DNS Records` - A, AAA, CNAME, MX, NS  
- `Zone File` - contains DNS records  
- `Name Server` - resolves DNS queries  
- `Top Level Domain` - .com, .gov, .org  
- `Second Level Domain` - amazon.com, google.com  

### Route 53 - Overview  
- A highly available, scalable, fully managed and *Authorative* DNS  
  - *Authorative* means the customer has full control over the DNS records  
- Route 53 is also a `Domain Registrar`  
- Ability to check the health of your resources  
- The only AWS service which provides 100% availability SLA  
- Why the name Route 53? 53 is a reference to the traditional DNS port  

### Route 53 - Records  
- Records are used for routing of traffic for a domain  
- Each record contains:  
  - `Domain/subdomain Name`: example.com  
  - `Record Type`: A, AAAA  
  - `Value`: 12.34.56.78  
  - `Routing Policy`: how Route 53 responds to queries  
  - `TTL`: amount of time the record is cached at the DNS Resolvers  
- Route 53 supports the following DNS record types:  
  - A/AAAA/CNAME/NS  
  - CAA/DS/MX/NAPTR/PTR/SOA/TXT/SPF/SRV  

### Route 53 - Record Types  
- `A` : maps a hostname to an IPv4 address  
- `AAAA`: maps a hostname to an IPv6 address  
- `CNAME`: maps a hostname to another hostname  
  - The target is a domain name which must also have an A or AAAA record  
  - Can't create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex)  
  - eg: you can't create a CNAME for example.com but you can for sub.example.com  
- `NS`: Name Server for the hosted Zone  
  - Control how traffic is routed for a domain  

### Route 53 - Hosted Zones  
- A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its sub-domain  
- `Public Hosted Zone`: contains records that specify how to route traffic on the internet (public domain names)    
- `Private Hosted Zone`: contains records that specify how to route traffic within one or more VPCs (private domain names) - **app-1.company.internal**  
- You pay 50c per month per hosted zone  

### Route 53 - Public vs Private Hosted Zones  
- `Public`: can answer queries from public clients  
- `Private`: can answer queries from private clients only (within your VPC)  

### Route 53 - Registering a Domain  
- Under Domains -> `Registered domains` -> `Register domains`  
- This is the same place that you can transfer a domain, so instead of Register domains, click on `Transfer in`  

### Route 53 - Creating Records  
- Go to `Hosted zones`  
- Click on the zone  
- Under the `Records` tab, click on `Create record`  
  - Add the record that you require, filling out things like:  
    - record name, record type, value, ttl and routing policy

### Route 53 - TTL  
- Time To Live, how long a record is valid before it expires and needs to be refreshed  
- `High TTL` - 24 hours  
  - less traffic on Route 53  
  - possibly encounter outdated records more frequently  
- `Low TTL` - 60 seconds   
  - more traffic on Route 53 (costlier)  
  - records are outdated more frequently  
  - easier to change records  
- `EXAM TIP`: **All records require a TTL, except an Alias record**  

### Route 53 - CNAME vs Alias  
- AWS Resources like Load Balancers or CloudFront expose an AWS hostname  
  - something like `lbl-54321.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com`  
  - you would like to use `app.example.com`  
- `CNAME`  
  - points to a hostname to any other hostname - `apps.example.com` -> `no-access.rubbish-links.com`  
  - `EXAM TIP`: `Only used for non-root domains` so, it has to me a subdomain  
- `ALIAS`  
  - points a hostname to an AWS Resource - `apps.example.com` -> `my-app.amazon.aws.com`  
  - `EXAM TIP`: `Works for ROOT domain and NON-ROOT domains` - `alykes-apps-on-aws.com` -> `lbl-54321.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com`  
  - It is free of charge  
  - Native health check

### Route 53 - Alias Records  
- Maps a hostname to an AWS resource  
- an extension to DNS functionality  
- automatically recognises changes in the resource IP address  
- unlike CNAME, it can be used for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex) - example.com  
- Alias Record is always of type A/AAA for AWS resources, there is a radio button near the value text box to enable ALIAS values, you select them from a dropdown    
- `EXAM TIP`: **You cannot set the TTL on an ALIAS record**  

### Route 53 - Alias Record Targets  
- ELBs  
- Coloudfront distros  
- API Gateways  
- Elastic Beanstalk environments  
- S3 websites  
- VPC interface endpoints  
- Global Accelerator  
- Route 53 record in the same hosted zone  
- `EXAM TIP`: **you cannot set an ALIAS record for an EC2 DNS name**  

### Routing Policies - Overview  
- Defines how route 53 responds to DNS queries  
- The word **routing** can add confusion, it's not like network routing in the traditional sense, route 53 just respnds to DNS requests  
- Route 53 supports the following routing policies:  
  - simple  
  - weighted  
  - failover  
  - latency based  
  - geolocation  
  - multi-value answer  
  - geoproximity - by taking advantage of the Route 53 **Traffic Flow** feature

### Routing Policies - Simple
- Typically route traffic to a single resource  
- can specify multiple values in the same record  
- `EXAM TIP`: If multiple values are returned, a random one is chosen by the client  
- when ALIAS is enabled, you can only specify one resource  
- can't be associated with Health Checks  

### Routing Policies - Weighted  
- Allows you to control the percentage of the requests that go to each specific resource  
- Assign each record a relative weight:  
  - traffic(%) = (weight for a specific record) / (sum of all the weights of all records)  
  - weights don't need to have a specific total, you can pick any number  
- DNS records must have the same name and type  
- can be associated with Health Checks  
- use case:  
  - load balancing between regions, testing new application versions  
- `EXAM TIP`: assign a weight of `0` to a record to stop sending traffic to a resource  
- `EXAM TIP`: if all records have a weight of `0`, then all records will be returned equally  

### Routing Policies - Latency  
- redirect to the resource that has the least latency to the client  
- used when low latency is a priority  
- `EXAM TIP`: latency is based on traffic between users and AWS Regions  
- Germany users may be directed to the US - if that has the lowest latency  
- can be associated with health checks  
- has a fail over capability  
- **when you add the record, you also need to select the** `AWS Region` **that it is in**  

### Route 53 - Health Checks  
- HTTP Health Checks are mainly for only for `public resources`  
- Health Check can facilitate Automated DNS Failover by one of the following methods:  
  - Health Checks that `monitor an endpoint` (application, server or other resources)  
  - Health Checks that `monitor other health checks` (also known as a `Calculated Health Check`)  
  - Health Checks that `monitor Cloudwatch alarms` 
    - throttles DynamoDB, alarms on RDS, custom metrics - great for private resources  
- Health Checks are integrated with CloudWatch metrics  

### Health Checks - Monitoring an Endpoint  
- `EXAM TIP`: **About 15 global health checkers will check the endpoint health**  
  - `Healthy/Unhealthy threshold` - 3 (default)  
  - `Interval` - 30 seconds (standard) but can be set to 10 seconds (fast) at a higher cost  
  - `Supported Protocols` - HTTP, HTTPS, TCP  
  - `If > 18% of health checkers report the endpoint is healthy`, Route 53 considers it `Healthy`.  Otherwise, it's `Unhealthy`  
  - Ability to choose which locations you want Route 53 to use for the health checks  
- Health checks pass only when the endpoint responds with 2xx or 3xx status codes  
- Health Checks can be setup to pass/fail based on a text based response by looking at the first `5120` bytes of the response  
- Configure your router/firewall to allow incoming request from Route 53 Health Checkers  
  - The IPs of the health checkers can be found here:  https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json  <-- `This is a really valuable URL!`  

### Health Checks - Calculated Health Checks  
- Allows you to combine the results of multiple Health Checks into a Single Health Check  
- You can use logical operators such as `OR`, `AND` and `NOT`  
- You can monitor up to 256 child health checks  
- Specify how many of the health checks need to pass to make the parent pass  
- Usage: Perform maintenance to your website without causing all the health checks to fail  

### Health Checks - CloudWatch alarm (Private Hosted Zones)  
- Route 53 health checkers are outside of the VPC  
- They can't access **private** endpoints whether they are in the VPC or on-prem resources  
- To monitor a resource in a Private subnet:  
  - you can create a CloudWatch Metric  
  - Associate a CloudWatch Alarm to it  
  - Create a Health Check that checks the alarm itself  

### Routing Policies - Failover (Active/Passive)  
- When you set up a DNS A record for the failover, eg, `failover.example.com` 
- You select whether the `Failover record type` is - **Primary** or **Secondary**  
- You must also select a health check to associate it to    
- If both the primary and the secondary health checks fail at the same time, a DNS query will keep returning the seconday IP address  

### Routing Policies - Geolocation  
- This is **NOT** latency based routing  
- `EXAM TIP`: **Quite simply, this routing policy is based on the user location**  
- Specify location by Continent, Country or by US State  
- Create a **Default** record in case there is no "matched" location  
- `EXAM TIP`: **If you don't set up a default record, you will get a** `no response` **from a DNS query**  
- Use Cases:  website localisation, restrict content distribution, load balancing  
- can be associated with health checks  

### Routing Policies - Geoproximity  
- Allows you to route traffic to your resouces based on the geographic location of users and resources  
- `EXAM TIP`: Provides the ability to `shift more traffic to resources based on the defined bias`  
- You can change the size of the geographic region by specifying bias values:  
  - To expand the area use `1 to 99` - more traffic to the resource  
  - To shrink the area use `-1 to -99` - less traffic to the resource  
- Resources can be:  
  - AWS resources - by specifying an AWS Region  
  - Non-AWS resource - by specifying a latitude and a longitude  
- You **MUST** use Traffic Flow (an advanced feature) to be able to use this  

### Routing Policies - IP Based  
- **Routing is based on a client's IP address**  
- **You provide a list of CIDR blocks for your clients** and the corresponding endpoints/locations (**user IP to endpoint mappings**)  
- Use Case: Optimise performance, reduce network costs  
- e.g., route end users from a particular ISP to a specific endpoint  

### Routing Policies - Multi-value  
- Use it when routing traffic to multiple resources  
- Route 53 returns multiple values or resources  
- can be associated with Health Checks - returns a value only if the health check passes  
- up to 8 healthy records are returned for each Multi-Value query  
- `EXAM TIP`: **Multi-Value is not a substitute for an ELB** - it is more of a `client-side` load balancer!    
- It's different to simple routing policy with multiple values in it because you can perform health checks on each record!  

### Route 53 - Domain Registrar vs DNS Service  
- You buy or register your domain name with a domain registrar typically by paying annual charges (GoDaddy, Amazon Registrar Inc.)  
- The Domain Registrar usually provides you with a DNS service to manage your DNS record  
  - albeit, you can use whichever DNS Service you want to manage your DNS Zone/Records     
- So for example, you can purchase a domain name with goDaddy and use Amazon Route 53 to manage your DNS records  

### Route 53 - 3rd Party Registrars with Amazon Route 53  
- `EXAM TIP`: **If you buy your domain from a 3rd party registrar, you can still use Route 53 as the DNS Service Provider**  
- To do so:  
  - Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53  
  - Update NS Records on the 3rd party website to use Route 53 **Name Servers**     
- **NOTE**: Domain Registrar is not the same as a DNS Service  
- ...but every registrar generally have some DNS features available to manage your DNS Zone
