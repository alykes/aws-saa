## Section 6 - EC2 - Solutions Architect Associate Level  

### Private vs Public IP (ipv4)  
ipv6 is also supported by AWS, it is mainly useful for IoT devices.  

- Public IP:  
  - Public IP can be geo-located  
  - Must be unique  
- Private IP:  
  - Can't be accessed over the internet  
  - Doesn't need to be unique outside of their own network space  
  - Machines connect to the internet using NAT and an internet gateway  
  - Private IPs can only be a specific set of IP ranges; 10.0.0.0/8, 192.0.0.0/24, 172.16.0.0/12
- Elastic IP:  
  - When you stop and start an EC2 instance; there is a possibility that it will change, Elastic IP will solve this  
  - Retains a fixed public IP  
  - You can remap the address from one instance to another instance in your account - (which can mask a failure)  
  - You only get 5 by default, you can request an increase via a service limit request  
  - If you use it or not, you still get charged for it.  
  - Once you disassociate the Elastic IP from an instance or a network interface, you need to `release` it.
- Recommendation is to **avoid using an Elastic IP**:  
  - They often reflect poor architectural decisions  
  - use a random public IP and register a DNS to it  
  - use a Load Balancer  
  - **If your EC2 instance is stopped and then restarted, the public IP can change.**  

### EC2 Placement Groups  
- Found under `EC2` -> `Network & Security`  
- For when you want to have control over the EC2 instance placement strategy  
- This option is found at launch time under **Advanced Details**  
- When you create a placement group, you specify one of the following strategies for the group:  
  - `Cluster`: clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single AZ  
  - `Spread`: spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ) - **used for critical applications**  
  - `Partition`: spreads instances across many different partitions (these are different server racks and are isolated from one another) within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group - **good for hadoop, cassandra, kafka**    

- `Cluster`  
  - Same Rack and Same AZ  
  - Pros:  
    - 10Gbps bandwidth between instances  
  - Cons:  
    - If the rack fails, all instances fail at the same time  
  - Use Cases:  
    - Big Data jobs that need to complete quickly  
    - Applications that need extremely low latency and high network throughput  
- `Spread`  
  - All instances are located in different AZs and on different hardware  
  - Pros:  
    - Spans multiple AZs  
    - reduced risk of simulataneous failures  
    - EC2 instances are on different physical hardware  
  - Cons:  
    - Limited to 7 instances per AZ and per placement group  
  - Use Cases:  
    - Application that needs high availability  
    - Critical Applications where each instance must be isolated from each other to minimise failure  
- `Partition`  
  - Up to **7** partitions per AZ  
  - Can span across multiple AZs in the same region  
  - Up to 100s of EC2 instances  
  - The instances in a partition do not share racks with the instances in other partitions  
  - A partition failure can affect many EC2 instances but won't affect the other partitions  
  - **EC2 instances get access to the partition information as metadata**  
  - Use cases:  
    - HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka  

### Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)  
- Logical component in a VPC that represents a **virtual network card**  
- The ENI can have the following attributes:  
  - Primary private IPv4; one or more secondary IPv4  
  - One Elastic IP per private IP  
  - Only one public IPv4  
  - One or more security groups  
  - A MAC Address  
- You can create an ENI independently and attach them to EC2 instances on the fly, and move them when required (in case of EC2 failure)  
- An ENI is bound to a specific AZ  
- Once an EC2 instance is terminated, the user created ENI will not be deleted

### EC2 Hibernate  
- The in-memory RAM state is **preserved**  
- Instance boot time is much faster (because the instance is not stopped and restarted)  
- The RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume, therefore the volume must be at least the same size as the RAM    
- The root EBS volume **must** be encrypted  
- Needs to be enabled on instance launch, under `Advanced Details`, then `Stop - Hibernate Behaviour` should be changed to `Enable`  
- Use Cases:  
  - Long running processing  
  - Saving the RAM state  
  - Services that take time to initialise  
- Good to know:  
  - `Supported instance families`: C,R,I,M...lots of them    
  - `Instance RAM size`: must be less than 150GB  
  - `Instance Size`: not supported for bare metal instances  
  - `AMI`: Amazon Linux 2, Linux AMI, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS & Windows  
  - `RootVolume`: must be an encrypted EBS volume and **NOT** an instance store, it must also be large  
  - Available for `On-Demand`, `Reserved` and `Spot Instances`  
  - An instance can **NOT** be hibernated for more than **60 days**
