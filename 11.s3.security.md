## Section 13 - Amazon S3 Security  

### Amazon S3 - Object Encryption  
- You can encrypt objects in S3 buckets using one of 4 methods  
- `Server Side Encryption (SSE)`  
  - `Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)` - Enabled by default  
    - Encrypts S3 objects using keys handled, managed and owned by AWS  
  - `Server-Side Encryption with KMS Keys stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)`  
    - Leverages AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to manage encryption keys  
  - `Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)`  
    - When you want to manage your own encryption keys  
  - `Client Side Encryption`  
    - When a client manages the keys that are used for encryption  
- It's important to understand which ones are used for particular situations, especially for the exam  

### Amazon S3 Encryption - SSE S3
